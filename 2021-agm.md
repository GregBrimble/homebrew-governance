# Homebrew Annaul General Meeting 2021

## Voting Mechanism

### Project Leader

The Homebrew Project Leader will be chosen by holding an [Schulze Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) election. This popular method of voting is used by several organizations such as Wikimedia, Debian and Ubuntu. The single highest-ranked candidate will be elected to become the Project Leader.

Voting by proxy is permitted, and proxy votes count towards the quorum for the election.

### Project Leadership Committee (PLC)

The Homebrew Project Leadership Committee will be chosen by holding a [Meek Single Transferable Vote (STV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_single_transferable_votes#Meek) election. The quota (threshold) of votes for a candidate to be elected will be calculated using the [Droop quota formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota).

Voting by proxy is permitted, and proxy votes count towards the quorum for the election.
